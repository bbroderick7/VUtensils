                    <p>
                      This Rental Agreement is the contract between you, as the lessee (“you”), and VUtensils, as
lessor (“we” or “us”), with respect to the rental of the kitchen set and/or specialty item (in each
case, the “Rental Property”).
Rental Term: You agree to rent from us for the period identified in your order (the “Rental
Term”) the Rental Property. Before the end of the Rental Term, we will notify you of the pickup
dates (each, a “Return Date”) by email or other means. You agree to make the Rental Property
available for pickup on one of the Return Dates and to notify us of the Return Date that you have
selected at least 5 calendar days prior to such Return Date. If you want to extend the Rental Term
until the weekend that occurs immediately after the date of spring graduation, you may request
that extension by notifying us by the method that we specify, which extension we may grant or
deny in our sole discretion. If we grant such extension, we will notify you by email or other
means of the additional charge for the extension period (the “Extension Charge”), which
Extension Charge you agree to pay. You agree that if you return the Rental Property prior to the
end of the Rental Term, you will still owe us the rental price for the entire Rental Term and for
all of the other charges identified in this Rental Agreement. 
Charges: You agree to pay us the rental price identified in your order with us (plus the Extension
Charge, if any), which price and Extension Charge you acknowledge include both the rental fee
plus applicable sales or use tax. You hereby authorize us to charge the credit card number that
you provided us for the rental price identified in your order with us (plus the Extension Charge,
if any) and for all other charges arising out of or related to this Rental Agreement or the Rental
Property; and you hereby agree that this authorization is irrevocable. 
Warranties: We will deliver the Rental Property to you in good condition. We agree to repair or
replace, at our sole option, any Rental Property that during the Rental Term breaks or becomes
unusable solely as a result of normal wear and tear. You agree that we do not make any other
warranties and that WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR MERCHANTABILITY. 
Your Responsibilities for Maintaining the Rental Property: You agree to maintain the Rental
Property in the same condition that we delivered it to you (normal wear and tear excepted), to
use the Rental Property only for use as a food/beverage preparation utensil, as applicable, and to
return the Rental Property to us at the end of the Rental Term. You agree that, unless you receive
our prior written permission, the Rental Property will not be removed from the dorm room or, if
we deliver it to an address that is not a dorm room, to the address to which we delivered it. If, in
our sole opinion, you return the Rental Property to us at the end of the Rental Term scratched,
stained, damaged or otherwise not in the same condition that we delivered it to you (normal wear
and tear excepted), you agree that we are authorized to charge the credit card number that you
provided us for the full retail replacement cost of the Rental Property. 
Security Interest and Protection of the Rental Property: You acknowledge and agree that this
transaction is a lease and not a conditional sale or financing agreement. You further acknowledge

2
and agree that title and ownership to the Rental Property remains vested in us at all times, and
that you may not, and have no right to, grant a security interest in or other lien or encumbrance
of any kind (collectively, “Liens”) on the Rental Property. You agree to keep the Rental Property
free and clear of all levies, attachments and Liens at all times. In the event that any person or
entity attempts to create or assert a Lien on the Rental Property, you agree to notify us
immediately in writing and take all actions that we require. 
Default: In the event that (1) you default by failing to pay any amount owed under this Rental
Agreement, (2) you fail to comply with any other provision of this Rental Agreement, or (3) you
file or have filed against you any bankruptcy or receivership petition, then we shall have the
immediate right to terminate this Rental Agreement and take immediate possession of the Rental
Property, wherever located, without notice or legal process. Your obligations to us under this
Rental Agreement shall survive any such default, and you agree to pay all costs of collection and
all costs of enforcing this Rental Agreement, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and
costs. You hereby agree that any action or proceeding arising from or in connection with this
Rental Agreement or the Rental Property may be instituted by us in any state or federal court in
Davidson County, Tennessee. BOTH YOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THAT
EITHER YOU OR WE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS RENTAL
AGREEMENT OR THE RENTAL PROPERTY.
 
Entire Agreement: You and we agree that this Rental Agreement sets forth the entire agreement
between you and us with respect to the lease of the Rental Property. You and we agree that any
amendment to this Rental Agreement must be in writing and signed by you and us.
